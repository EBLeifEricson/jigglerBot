# jigglerBot
 A basic Twitch bot for speedrunners.
 
 This is based off of an old branch that was given to a friend who happened to not speedrun, so conveniently the commands related to speedruns were removed. Since I wanted to make this open source, I plan to reimpliment the missing functions based off of the older code and work from there.
 
 The following libraries are needed to compile from source:
 * libircclient v1.8
 * curl v7.68
 
 It is currently Windows only.
