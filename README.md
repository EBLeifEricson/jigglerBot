# jigglerBot
 A basic Twitch bot for speedrunners.
 
 This is based off of an old branch that was given to a friend who happened to not speedrun, so conveniently the commands related to speedruns were removed. Since I wanted to make this open source, I plan to reimpliment the missing functions based off of the older code and work from there.
 
 Features
 * Built in functions such as quoting, message of the day, and adding/removing of basic text commands
 * Ability to use your own account or a custom account using OAuth
 * Custom moderators list independent of Twitch chat moderators
 * Viewing and logging of Twitch chat via console
 
 Planned Features
 * SRC connectivity to list a game's current world record, user personal bests, etc
 
 The following libraries are needed to compile from source:
 * libircclient v1.8
 * curl v7.68
 
 It is currently Windows only.
